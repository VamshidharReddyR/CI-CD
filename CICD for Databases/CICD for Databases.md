**CI/CD for Databases Using GitHub Actions and Neon**

**Introduction**

This repository demonstrates how to implement **CI/CD for databases** using **GitHub Actions** and **Neon**, a managed PostgreSQL platform.

Many teams struggle with database, especially when handling **ephemeral database environments**. This guide provides a solution to automate database testing in CI/CD pipelines while ensuring **cost efficiency, database stability**, and **developer isolation**.

**Problem Statement**

**Traditional Database CI/CD Challenges**

Companies often maintain different database environments:

**1.	Production (Prod)** – Serves live customer requests.

**2.	Staging (Pre-Prod)** – A copy of Prod for testing and debugging.

**3.	Development (Dev)** – Used for feature development.

A common practice is to use **a single shared Dev database** for all developers. However, this leads to several issues:

•	Developers **overwrite** each other’s changes.

•	Schema changes by one developer may **break** another developer’s work.

•	Accidental queries can **corrupt** the database, requiring DevOps teams to restore it.

•	Teams create **separate database instances** for each project, increasing cloud costs.

**Solution: Using Ephemeral Databases**

To overcome these challenges, we can use **ephemeral database environments**, where:

•	A **temporary copy** of the Dev database is created for each **pull request (PR)**.

•	Changes are **validated** against this isolated copy.

•	The copy is **deleted** once the PR is merged or closed.

This approach ensures that the Dev database remains **stable** and prevents **conflicts** between developers.

**Using Neon for Ephemeral Databases**

**Neon** is a **cloud-based PostgreSQL platform** that offers **branching**, allowing us to create database copies dynamically.

With **Neon**, we can:

•	**Create a free PostgreSQL database**.

•	**Use database branching** to create ephemeral environments.

•	**Integrate with GitHub Actions** to automate database lifecycle management.

**Setting Up Neon**

**1.	Create a Free Neon Account**

o	Sign up at **Neon** (https://neon.tech/) using GitHub or Google.

o	Create a new project (e.g., cicd-demo).

o	Select **PostgreSQL** and choose a region.

**2.	Connect to the Database**

o	Copy the **database connection string** from Neon.

o	Add it to your application's .env file.

o	Ensure that .env is excluded from Git by adding it to .gitignore.

**3.	Understand Branching in Neon**

o	The **main branch** acts as the primary database.

o	Additional **branches (copies)** can be created dynamically.

o	Each developer can work in an **isolated branch** without affecting others.

**Setting Up GitHub Actions for Database CI/CD**

GitHub Actions will automate the creation and deletion of **ephemeral database branches**.

**Steps to Integrate GitHub Actions with Neon**

**1.	Connect Neon to GitHub**

o	Go to **Neon Console → Integrations → GitHub**.

o	Connect your repository (e.g., cicd-for-databases).

o	Neon automatically adds:

	**API Key** to GitHub Secrets.

	**Project ID** as a GitHub Variable.

**2.	Create a GitHub Workflow File**

o	In your repository, create a file at .github/workflows/neon-ci.yml.

o	Add the following workflow:

```sh
name: CI/CD for Databases

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronized, closed]

jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      branch_name: ${{ steps.get_branch_name.outputs.branch_name }}
    steps:
      - name: Generate Unique Branch Name
        id: get_branch_name
        run: echo "::set-output name=branch_name::pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"

  create-branch:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.action != 'closed'
    steps:
      - name: Create Neon Database Branch
        uses: neon-tech/create-branch@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
          project_id: ${{ secrets.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
          branch_name: ${{ needs.setup.outputs.branch_name }}

  delete-branch:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.action == 'closed'
    steps:
      - name: Delete Neon Database Branch
        uses: neon-tech/delete-branch@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
          project_id: ${{ secrets.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
          branch_name: ${{ needs.setup.outputs.branch_name }}
```

**3.	Add Database Migration Commands**

Modify the create-branch job to run database migrations:

```sh
- name: Run Database Migrations
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run migrate up
```

**Demonstration: Testing the Pipeline**

**1.	Push Code to GitHub**

o	Create a repository named cicd-for-databases.

o	Push a **Node.js To-Do Application** that interacts with Neon.

**2.	Open a Pull Request (PR)**

o	Modify the database schema in migrations/.

o	Create a new branch, e.g., test-db-migrate.

o	Open a PR to merge it into the main branch.

**3.	Observe GitHub Actions Execution**

o	GitHub Actions will:

	Generate a **unique database branch** (e.g., pr-8-test-db-migrate).

	Apply migrations to the **ephemeral database copy**.

	Validate the PR changes.

**4.	Merge or Close the PR**

o	If the PR is **merged or closed**, the **ephemeral database copy is deleted**.

**Conclusion**

By integrating **Neon** with **GitHub Actions**, we successfully implemented a **CI/CD pipeline for databases** that:

•	**Creates ephemeral database copies** for each PR.

•	**Runs database migrations** in an isolated environment.

•	**Deletes the copy** after the PR is merged or closed.

This setup improves **developer productivity, prevents database corruption**, and **optimizes cloud costs**.
